          its extraordinary variety if its sea life. Due to its great flora and
          fauna, Maldives is one of the most amazing places for snorkeling. The
          Maldives are a group of islands in South of India in Indian Oceans
          which offers a stunning snorkeling destination. The reefs in waters of
          Maldives are primarily hard corals, a mix of table, finger, staghorn,
          boulder, lobe, and brain corals. One can also have a look at an
          incredible variety of fishes and other aquatic creatures such as
          anemonefish, colourful Giant Clams, Blacktip and Whitetip Reef Sharks,
          Hawksbill Turtles, Whale Sharks, Eagle Rays, massive schools of
          brilliant fusiliers, Clown Triggerfish, butterflyfish, bannerfish, and
          various types of octopus. If you ever plan a snorkeling trip to the
          Maldives, then March is the best month for the trip.

        <h3><a href="images/img6.jpg" target="_blank">Water Skiing</a></h3>
        <p>
          Water Skiing is one of the easiest and enjoyable water sports in the
          Maldives. Water Skiing is done in two ways in one way the person is
          pulled behind a boat and in the second way a cable ski is installed on
          ocean water. This is a safe sport and you can find a lot of lifeguards
          on the coast in time of need. Water Skiing is not a good option in
          months from June through September as it is a rainy season making it
          difficult to ski in high winds, rain and choppy ocean currents.
